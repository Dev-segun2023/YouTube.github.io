this project encompasses 97% of HTML5 and CSS3 required knowledge for a frontend web developer.
knowledge like css grid,flex box, css specificity, css positions,pseudo class, image styling, text element, tool tip styling and more.

The project is divided into 2 sections:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3


Each section is further divided into sub-sections, each containing a set of challenges that test your knowledge and skills in that area.

I intend to revisit this project in the future, adding javascript for better functionality and better responsiveness from largest to smallest possible screen sizes. Targetting the header especially. Though, the project is responsive.



I hope you find this project meaningful , helpful and enjoyable!
